Here are the changes made to the code after not getting any detection:

In the cv2.HoughLinesP function call, the threshold parameter has been lowered from 100 to 50, the minLineLength parameter has been lowered from 100 to 50, and the maxLineGap parameter has been increased from 10 to 20. These changes should help detect more line segments and draw lines around the objects in the image.

In the cv2.rectangle function call, the color argument has been changed from (0, 0, 255) to (0, 0, 255) to draw red lines around the objects.

Try running this updated code and see if it produces the desired results.
